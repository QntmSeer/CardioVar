# CardioVar
A free, modular tool for analyzing how non-coding genetic variants affect heart-specific gene expression using DeepMind's AlphaGenome.

## ðŸ”¬ Features
- Query AlphaGenome for RNA-seq prediction in heart tissue
- Visualize variant-driven shifts in RNA expression
- Annotate affected regions with Ensembl gene models
- Prioritize cardiovascular disease-relevant loci

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Use the `app.ipynb` notebook on Colab or run locally:
